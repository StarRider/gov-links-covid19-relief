# LINKS FOR COVID 19 RELIEF FUNDS

## Author's Request
**I encourage you to join hands with Indian Government for fighting back against COVID 19. It does not matter how much but the thing that matters is that you do your part for the country whether it's small or big.**   
## Platforms to contribute financially

1. **Prime Miniter's National Relief Fund** is a secure platform for contribution. Since COVID 19 has been notified as a disaster[1]         alongside natural calamities like quakes and floods. As per my view the funds should probably be used for fighting against COVID 19.<br>
	  This is a statement from the website which supports my view: The resources of 	the 	PMNRF are utilized to render immediate relief to families of those 	killed in natural calamities like floods, cyclones and earthquakes, etc.[2]<br> 
	  I mailed PMNRF regarding the contribution, solely for COVID 19 but, as per their 	reply, there is no proposal to PMNRF for COVID 19 (As on 24th March 2020).<br>
	  But there is a live example of donation, where we can see LS speaker Om Birla 	on 24th March contributed his one month's salary to PMNRF. [3]<br>
	  **Conclusion**: I am quiet sure that, if you are donating your money, it is not going 	elsewhere but to the Government of India and I am pretty much sure that, in this 	dire situation, this fund will be one of the major sources for the Government to 	fight back COVID 19.
